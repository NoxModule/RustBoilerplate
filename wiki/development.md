# Development

This document focuses on pieces around local development and is centered around [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode) as the development environment.

Get started by opening the [`.vscode/rust_boilerplate.code-workspace`](../.vscode/rust_boilerplate.code-workspace) VSCode workspace.

## Setup

1. Install the workspace's recommended VSCode extensions.
    - [C/C++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools) adds debugging features for Rust.
    - [Dependi](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fill-labs.dependi) is a dependency version manager.
    - [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml) adds language support for TOML.
    - [Rust Analyzer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust-analyzer) adds language support for Rust.

## Work Items

Instead of keeping work items in an external application, they are kept as [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files that describe features, technical debt and bugs in detail. These files are then moved around directories to keep track of their progress.
